    <br>
<p id="id">To Family & Friends, I'm truly saddened by his loss and I felt compelled to convey my profound condolences to his immediate family and fellow workers. I'm an avid user of many of your products and have always found Steve Jobs inspirational in a variety ways. I'm about the same age and, without getting into details, have followed the 'Apple Story' since its inception. "Think Different', indeed. A loyal fan of man and company.

<h3 style="max-width: 580px;">Condolences</h3>
<p id="id">Hi there, Just want to send out my condolences to both Mr. Jobs' family and friends, and the Apple company. He was an amazing inspiration to all of us, and had a direct influence on me through his speech at his 2005 Stanford commencement speech. May he rest in peace and may God forgive him for his sins and have mercy on him. All the best to his family and their futures.</p>

<h3 style="max-width: 720px;">With heartfelt love and sadness</h3>

<p id="id">To the Jobs family and Apple corporation, my heart goes out for the loss of this great man. His vision for life has truly been an example for me and everyone who is astonished for his love to follow. His spirit and energy will forever be a part of the reason why we never give up on ourselves and our dreams of being  writers. Partly because of Steve Jobs I now believe and see the dots connecting in our lives, thanks so much Steve for being our hero.   With love and compassion</p>
